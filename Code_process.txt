1. Define the 'generator' network structure, see generator_simplified_api

2. Define the 'discriminator' network structure, see discriminator_simplified_api

3. 'discriminator' is used as feature extractor to extract features, see feature.outputs.

4. Input the extracted features into SVM for classification, see GBM classification using SVM
